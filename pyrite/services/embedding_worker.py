Background Embedding Worker

Manages a SQLite-backed queue of entries to embed asynchronously.
Decouples write latency from embedding computation.

The embed_queue table is app-state (not in SearchBackend) — it manages
internal processing state, not knowledge-index data.

Usage:
    worker = EmbeddingWorker(db)
    worker.enqueue("entry-id", "kb-name")
    processed = worker.process_batch(batch_size=10)
    status = worker.get_status()
